        Inspired by places around the world featured in the <a
          href="http://soundtent.org/soundcamp_reveil.html"><i>Reveil</i></a> 24-hour audio stream, students of <a
          href="https://www.hochschule-trier.de/en/">TUAS Trier</a> have designed
        birdhouses.
      </p>
      <p class="concept">
        What was supposed to be a sound installation created in collaboration with the factulty <a
          href="https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/faculties/digital-media/" target="_blank">Digital Media</a> of <a
          href="https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/" target="_blank"> Furtwangen University</a>, where sounds from
        all over the world come together in an acoustic observatory, remains this year a simple website that presents the
        <i>Bird Sound Houses</i> with the associated audio <img class="audio-link small" src="images/audio.png"> livestreams.

        To give our bird house a character that fits to our location we choose to take some elements of
        the surrounding, such as the style of the houses, the mountains, the trees, the river and the sky. In the
        background of this specific area there are mountains which form a zig-zag string and remember of the shape of a
        triangle or the river, which is why we created a similar shape for our stem. We hope the birds will like it
        and
        feel secure in our bird house.

        This urban backyard is surrounded by the typical Georgian Houses featuring colorful doors.
        To connect the backyard with the streets at the front end of the houses we constructed our birdhouse from four
        doors we found on Google Streetview around Loughborough Junction, topping it with the typical Georgian Hipped
        Roof.

      </a>
      <p class="concept">
        The birdhouse we designed is clearly inspired by the street called <i>Tábor</i> which the house is virtually
        placed on. It ́s a house for the resident bird breeds and combines the styles of the right and left side
        buildings on the street itself. On the street we can discover houses built in the functionalism aswell as
        classicism-style.
        Also the birdhouse gives an impression of standing in front of a fassade but at the same time it seems like
        you are looking down on the street from a birds perspective.

        I wanted my birdhouse to perfectly match the rocky, cliffy environment of my location. So what I did was to
        create a usual, rectangular birdhouse as a base and then I created this rock like structure around it. When
        I’ll build it, there will be moss or some other green details included, so it matches the environment even
        better.

      <p class="concept">
        Inspired by a stone building on the property of Flora & Fauna Preservation Park and a building in the
        surrounding area, we created a teardrop-shaped design for the birdhouse to combine the characteristic elements
        of the park and the surrounding buildings. The recess at the top is used to hang the nesting box, so you can
        hang the structure from a branch without damaging the tree. The stones are glued or attached to the wooden
        frame
        with wire. Between the stones are fixed small bags of soil to allow the growth of climbing plants.
        The diameter of the entrance hole of 34mm allows most – small to medium-sized – domestic birds (eg, chaffinch,
        goldfinch, song thrush,...) to use the box.

      </a>
      <p class="concept">
        This birdhouse was inspired by a traditional Russian fairy tail character – Baba-Yaga –, who lived in a wooden
        house, that had chicken legs. In the Moscow Region in villages and in Bakovka as well, there are still many
        wooden hoses of this kind. You can see a very modern chimney at the top, this is due to the fact, that
        Bakovka,
        being a normal Russian village is situated right to the biggest innovation Center of Russia – Skolkovo.
        The colors are inspired by one of the numerous birds living in the area – the Kingfisher.

        This airship like bird house is inspired by the wonderful candy color of the Swedish historic buildings and
        the
        lovely train that seems only to appear in a cartoon movie. Under this wonderland vibe a mediocre design is
        definitely unacceptable. The bird house mainly consists of an oval shaped little cabin, which is made of thin
        wood chip, aka. splint. And will be fixed to the trunk with a sturdy net bag.

      <p class="concept">
        The soundbox is located in an Irish city called Cork City. The area has detached houses and beautiful green
        gardens and front yards where birds can feel at home. The soundbox hangs on the top floor of a brick house,
        which
        has very nice bay windows. These elements and the colors of the house were integrated into the birdhouse for
        sparrows.
